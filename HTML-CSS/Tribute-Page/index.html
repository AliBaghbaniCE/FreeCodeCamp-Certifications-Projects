          On 13 August 2014, Mirzakhani was honored with the Fields Medal, the most prestigious award in mathematics,
          becoming the first Iranian to be honored with the award and the only woman to date.

      <h2 class="timeline-title">Here's a time line of Prof. Maryam Mirzakhani's life:</h2>
      <ul class="tribute-timeline">
        <li><strong>1977</strong> - born on 12 May in Tehran, Iran.</li>
        <li><strong>1994</strong> - became the first Iranian woman to win a gold medal at the International Mathematical
          Olympiad in Hong Kong, scoring 41 out of 42 points.</li>
        <li><strong>1998</strong> - On 17 March, after attending a conference consisting of gifted individuals and
          former Olympiad competitors, Mirzakhani and Zavareh, along with other attendees, boarded a bus in Ahvaz en
          route to Tehran. The bus was involved in an accident wherein it fell off a cliff, killing seven of the
          passengers—all Sharif University students. This incident is widely considered a national tragedy in Iran.
          Mirzakhani and Zavareh were two of the few survivors.</li>
        <li><strong>1999</strong> - obtained a Bachelor of Science in mathematics from the Sharif University of
          Technology. During her time there, she received recognition from the American Mathematical Society for her
          work in developing a simple proof for a theorem of Schur.</li>
        <li><strong>2004</strong> - earned a PhD from Harvard University.</li>
        <li><strong>2008</strong> - married Jan Vondrák, a Czech theoretical computer scientist and applied
          mathematician who currently is an associate professor at Stanford University.</li>
        <li><strong>2009</strong> - became a professor at Stanford University.</li>
        <li><strong>2013</strong> - was diagnosed with breast cancer.</li>
        <li><strong>2014</strong> - was awarded the Fields Medal for "her outstanding contributions to the dynamics and
          geometry of Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces".</li>
        <li><strong>2016</strong> - the cancer spread to her bones and liver.</li>
        <li><strong>2017</strong> - died on 14 July at the age of 40 at Stanford Hospital in Stanford, California.</li>
      </ul>

        <p>[Her] work expertly blends dynamics with geometry. Among other things, she studies billiards. But now, in a
          move very characteristic of modern mathematics, it gets kind of meta: She considers not just one billiard
          table, but the universe of all possible billiard tables. And the kind of dynamics she studies doesn't directly
          concern the motion of the billiards on the table, but instead a transformation of the billiard table itself,
          which is changing its shape in a rule-governed way; if you like, the table itself moves like a strange planet
          around the universe of all possible tables ... This isn't the kind of thing you do to win at pool, but it's
          the kind of thing you do to win a Fields Medal. And it's what you need to do in order to expose the dynamics
          at the heart of geometry; for there's no question that they're there.</p>
