                        production—in minutes.

                        <p>
                            Bootstrap employs a handful of important global styles and settings, all of which are almost
                            exclusively geared towards the normalization of cross browser styles. Let's dive in.

                            Bootstrap requires the use of the HTML5 doctype. Without it, you'll see some funky and
                            incomplete
                            styling.

                        <p>
                            Bootstrap is developed mobile first, a strategy in which we optimize code for mobile devices
                            first
                            and then scale up components as necessary using CSS media queries. To ensure proper
                            rendering
                            and
                            touch zooming for all devices, add the responsive viewport meta tag to your &#60;head&#62;.
                        </p>
                        <code>&#60;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&#62;</code>

                        <h2>Box-sizing</h2>
                        <p>
                            For more straightforward sizing in CSS, we switch the global box-sizing value from
                            content-box
                            to
                            border-box. This ensures padding does not affect the final computed width of an element, but
                            it
                            can
                            cause problems with some third-party software like Google Maps and Google Custom Search
                            Engine.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the rare occasion you need to override it, use something like the following:
                        </p>
                        <code>.selector-for-some-widget {
box-sizing: content-box;
}</code>
                        <p>
                            With the above snippet, nested elements—including generated content via ::before and
                            ::after—will
                            all inherit the specified box-sizing for that .selector-for-some-widget.
                        </p>

                            Developers should use the keyword bootstrap on packages that modify or add to the
                            functionality
                            of
                            Bootstrap when distributing through npm or similar delivery mechanisms for maximum
                            discoverability.

                            Pull in Bootstrap's source files into nearly any project with some of the most popular
                            package
                            managers. No matter the package manager, Bootstrap will require a Sass compiler and
                            Autoprefixer
                            for
                            a setup that matches our official compiled versions.

                                Install Bootstrap in your Node.js powered apps with the npm package:
                            </p>
                            <code>npm install bootstrap@5.2.0-beta1</code>

                                const bootstrap = require('bootstrap') or import bootstrap from 'bootstrap' will load
                                all of
                                Bootstrap's plugins onto a bootstrap object. The bootstrap module itself exports all of
                                our
                                plugins. You can manually load Bootstrap's plugins individually by loading the
                                /js/dist/*.js
                                files under the package's top-level directory.

                        <p>
                            Alternative browsers which use the latest version of WebKit, Blink, or Gecko, whether
                            directly
                            or
                            via
                            the platform's web view API, are not explicitly supported. However, Bootstrap should (in
                            most
                            cases)

                            We use Autoprefixer to handle intended browser support via CSS prefixes, which uses

                            Generally speaking, Bootstrap supports the latest versions of each major platform's default
                            browsers.
                            Note that proxy browsers (such as Opera Mini, Opera Mobile's Turbo mode, UC Browser Mini,
                            Amazon
                            Silk) are not supported.

                            Similarly, the latest versions of most desktop browsers are supported.
                        </p>
                        <p>For Firefox, in addition to the latest normal stable release, we also support the latest

                                Support for overflow: hidden; on the &#60;body&#62; element is quite limited in iOS and
                                Android.
                                To that end, when you scroll past the top or bottom of a modal in either of those
                                devices'
                                browsers, the &#60;body&#62; content will begin to scroll. See Chrome bug #175502 (fixed
                                in
                                Chrome v40) and WebKit bug #153852.

                                As of iOS 9.2, while a modal is open, if the initial touch of a scroll gesture is within
                                the
                                boundary of a textual &#60;input&#62; or a &#60;textarea&#62;, the &#60;body&#62;
                                content
                                underneath the modal will be scrolled instead of the modal itself. See WebKit bug

                                The .dropdown-backdrop element isn't used on iOS in the nav because of the complexity of
                                z-indexing. Thus, to close dropdowns in navbars, you must directly click the dropdown
                                element
                                (or any other element which will fire a click event in iOS).

                                Page zooming inevitably presents rendering artifacts in some components, both in
                                Bootstrap
                                and
                                the rest of the web. Depending on the issue, we may be able to fix it (search first and
                                then
                                open an issue if need be). However, we tend to ignore these as they often have no direct
                                solution other than hacky workarounds.

                        <h2>Validators</h2>
                        <p>
                            In order to provide the best possible experience to old and buggy browsers, Bootstrap uses
                            CSS
                            browser hacks in several places to target special CSS to certain browser versions in order
                            to
                            work
                            around bugs in the browsers themselves. These hacks understandably cause CSS validators to
                            complain
                            that they are invalid. In a couple places, we also use bleeding-edge CSS features that
                            aren't
                            yet
                            fully standardized, but these are used purely for progressive enhancement.

                            These validation warnings don't matter in practice since the non-hacky portion of our CSS
                            does
                            fully

                            portion, hence why we deliberately ignore these particular warnings.

                            Our HTML docs likewise have some trivial and inconsequential HTML validation warnings due to
                            our
                            inclusion of a workaround for a certain Firefox bug.</p>

                        <p>
                            Bootstrap uses npm scripts to build the documentation and compile source files. Our
                            package.json
                            houses these scripts for compiling code, running tests, and more. These aren't intended for
                            use
                            outside our repository and documentation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To use our build system and run our documentation locally, you'll need a copy of Bootstrap's
                            source
                            files and Node. Follow these steps and you should be ready to rock:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Download and install Node.js, which we use to manage our dependencies.</li>
                            <li>Either download Bootstrap's sources or fork Bootstrap's repository.</li>
                            <li>Navigate to the root /bootstrap directory and run npm install to install our local
                                dependencies
                                listed in package.json.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            When completed, you'll be able to run the various commands provided from the command line.

                        <h2>Sass</h2>
                        <p>
                            Bootstrap uses Dart Sass for compiling our Sass source files into CSS files (included in our
                            build
                            process), and we recommend you do the same if you're compiling Sass using your own asset
                            pipeline.
                            We previously used Node Sass for Bootstrap v4, but LibSass and packages built on top of it,
                            including Node Sass, are now deprecated.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Dart Sass uses a rounding precision of 10 and for efficiency reasons does not allow
                            adjustment
                            of
                            this value. We don't lower this precision during further processing of our generated CSS,
                            such
                            as
                            during minification, but if you chose to do so we recommend maintaining a precision of at
                            least
                            6 to
                            prevent issues with browser rounding.

                        <h2>Autoprefixer</h2>
                        <p>
                            Bootstrap uses Autoprefixer (included in our build process) to automatically add vendor
                            prefixes
                            to
                            some CSS properties at build time. Doing so saves us time and code by allowing us to write
                            key
                            parts
                            of our CSS a single time while eliminating the need for vendor mixins like those found in
                            v3.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We maintain the list of browsers supported through Autoprefixer in a separate file within
                            our
                            GitHub
                            repository. See .browserslistrc for details.

                        <p>
                            Bootstrap uses RTLCSS to process compiled CSS and convert them to RTL - basically replacing
                            horizontal direction aware properties (eg. padding-left) with their opposite. It allows us
                            only
                            write our CSS a single time and make minor tweaks using RTLCSS control and value directives.

                        <p>
                            Running our documentation locally requires the use of Hugo, which gets installed via the
                            hugo-bin
                            npm
                            package. Hugo is a blazingly fast and quite extensible static site generator that provides
                            us:
                            basic
                            includes, Markdown-based files, templates, and more. Here's how to get it started:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Run through the tooling setup above to install all dependencies.</li>
                            <li>From the root /bootstrap directory, run npm run docs-serve in the command line.</li>
                            <li>Open http://localhost:9001/ in your browser, and voilà.</li>
                        </ol>
